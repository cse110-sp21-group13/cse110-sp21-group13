## Introduction
13ullet is a digital journal designed to mimic the benefits and constraints of a pen and paper bullet journaling system. Our focus is on an intuitive, guided system that allows users to make plans quickly and simply, without having to worry about maintaining the system itself. In this repository are all of the resources you need to create your own 13ullet app, as well as full documentation on our development process.
